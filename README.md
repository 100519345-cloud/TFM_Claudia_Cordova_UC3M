# TFM_Claudia_Cordova_UC3M
Masterâ€™s Thesis â€“ Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning: Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Estimation with the CMAPSS Dataset

This repository contains all code developed for the Masterâ€™s Thesis at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) as part of the Connected Industry 4.0 program.

The project implements a complete pipeline for predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of jet engines using supervised machine learning models. It includes:

- Data preprocessing and sensor selection
- Windowing of time-series sensor data
- Model training and evaluation (Linear Regression, Neural Network, LSTM)
- Performance comparison using RMSE and MAE metrics
